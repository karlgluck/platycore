# Platycore
It's a platform and the core of an application framework. Extensible, but resistant to magic.

This is basically a Huginn (github.com/huginn/huginn) for a Google Spreadsheet. An "agent" is a sheet with configuration up top and a debugging log down below. "Agents" communicate by through "channels", which are also data stored in sheets.

Why am I working on this? Well I want to automate my todo list, recruiter list, watch list, play list, shopping list, weight tracker, workout tracker, money / savings trackers, 1:1 trackers, friend hangout time trackers, holiday reminders, gift lists, idea lists, a bot that finds and buys things for me randomly on the internet, fill out websites showing the projects that I'm working on, find interesting articles for me to read and forward them, and ALL SORTS of other interesting and vaguely automatable tasks that could plug into a nice infrastructure.

So why not let Google take care of the infrastructure part and Github take care of the code sharing part?

Then I can get back to the work I was supposed to be doing...

But more efficiently this time!
