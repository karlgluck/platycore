Any line that doesn't start with a space is ignored, so we can
write whatever we like up here describing how this works!

   SELECT  "A2"
   TOGGLE  "ON"
        +  "TRUE"

--- MAIN ---
This is tricky. I use the same block of cells for the
field named SCRIPT, which holds the value MAIN, which
refers to the note so-named (MAIN), which happens to
also be placed on this same block of cells. Normally,
the SCRIPT field would be separate and would hold a
reference to one of several other NOTEs.

   SELECT  "L1:M1"
    FIELD  "SCRIPT"
     TEXT  "MAIN"
        +  "HORIZONTAL_MIDDLE"
    PANEL  "5"
     NOTE  "MAIN"
        +  "agent.Log(\"Hello!\");"
        +  "agent.Snooze(5 * 60 * 1000);"


   SELECT  "P2:W2"
  FORMULA  "=E1/1000/60/60/24+25568.6681"

      OFF
