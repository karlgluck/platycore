Any line that doesn't start with a space is ignored, so we can write whatever we like up here describing how this works!

--- MAIN ---
This is tricky. I use the same block of cells for the field named SCRIPT, which holds the value MAIN, which refers to the note so-named (MAIN), which happens to also be placed on this same block of cells. Normally, the SCRIPT field would be separate and would hold a reference to one of several other NOTEs.

   SELECT  "C2:D2"
    FIELD  "SCRIPT"
     TEXT  "MAIN"
        +  "HCENTER"
    PANEL  "5"
     NOTE  "MAIN"
        +  "agent.Log(\"Hello!\");"
        +  "agent.Snooze(15 * 1000);"

      OFF
