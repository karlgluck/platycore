Any line that doesn't start with a space is ignored, so we can write whatever we like up here describing how this works!

--- MAIN ---
This is tricky. I use the same block of cells for the field named SCRIPT, which holds the value MAIN, which refers to the note so-named (MAIN), which happens to also be placed on this same block of cells. Normally, the SCRIPT field would be separate and would hold a reference to one of several other NOTEs.

   SELECT  "C2:D2"
    FIELD  "SCRIPT"
     TEXT  "MAIN"
        +  "HCENTER"

Below is the only exception to the rule that "everything that doesn't start with a space is ignored".
When a line is entirely dashes and there is a matching line that is entirely dashes, and the line preceding the earlier line ends with a quoted set of dashes, then the quoted dashes are replaced with the JSON-encoded text content of the lines between the dashed lines, and all other text is removed.

var threads = GmailApp.getUserLabelByName(agent.ReadField('LABEL')).getThreads();
threads.forEach(function (thread) { agent.Log(thread.getFirstMessageSubject()) });
agent.WriteField('PROCESSED', Util_intCast(agent.ReadField('PROCESSED')) + threads.length);
agent.Snooze(15 * 60 * 1000);
